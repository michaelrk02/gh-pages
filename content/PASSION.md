I like coding, reading (mostly computer science & IT stuff), and playing with music. I discovered C programming language when I was at middle school and before that, I was playing around with Lua scripting language to modify certain video game scripts ([Counter-Strike 2D](https://www.cs2d.com/)) so I had so much fun doing coding itself. I am also usually referred to as an IT guy among my peers due to my high interest on tinkering with computer systems and troubleshooting programs. I also like OS virtualization which led me to the discovery of C programming language (with Turbo C at first!). After learning the basics of C and making simple programs, I decided to expand my knowledge by learning GUI & systems programming with C# (through .NET and Windows Forms) and later C++ (through Win32 API). While learning GUI & systems programming, I discovered an interesting graphics API which was DirectX and soon after that, I started to study minimal computer graphics with the help of DirectX SDK. I also looked for its portable alternative: OpenGL and decided to give it a try too. But in favor of DirectX due to its modular & object-oriented approach, I focused on experimenting with DirectX instead. As the result of learning computer graphics, I seeked for a simple game engine using C# (because I already mastered C# that time) and found Microsoft XNA Framework. Soon after that, I started to make my own simple games.
