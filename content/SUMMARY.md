In conclusion, I have experienced learning with many technologies and fields like GUI & systems programming, computer graphics & game development, and web development. Besides that, I also have a special interest in computer science subfield, that is, Parallel and Distributed Computing. When I was learning systems programming, I discovered the concept of RPC & concurrency and hence, I would like to master that field too. From now on, you can say my focuses are on web development and distributed systems.
